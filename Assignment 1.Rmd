# Research Question
How do food access and demographic characteristics impact mental and physical health on a county scale?

# Prior Research - AlL
Seligman and Schillinger (2010) posit that food insecurity and chronic disease follows a cyclical pattern where food insecurity leads to chronic disease, thereby increasing medical costs and causing low income households to make trade-offs in spending, often leading to less money available to address food insecurity.

* Access to food options within 1 mile urban or 10 miles rural
* SNAP recipients by housing units
* Percent of households using SNAP
* Poverty rate
```{r, message = FALSE, results = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
USDA <- read_csv("Food Access Research Atlas.csv") %>%

                           str_length(as.character(CensusTract)) == 10 ~ paste("0", CensusTract, sep=""),
                           TRUE ~ "not a tract")) %>%
  mutate(pct_SNAP = TractSNAP / OHU2010) %>%
  filter(CensusTract != "not a tract") %>%
  select(CensusTract, TractSNAP, OHU2010, pct_SNAP, PovertyRate, LA1and10)
